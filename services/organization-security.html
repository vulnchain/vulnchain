    <section>
        <p>The alarming increase in the number of attacks resulting in breakdown of security systems and weakening of the market position is causing concern to growing number of organizations. The strategy of taking bold steps towards achieving the most complete internal security is a topic that constantly returns to the boardroom agendas. Acting between offensive security and adverse events anticipation in cybersecurity contexts, we provide solid support for all our clients.</p>
        <p>In an era of global digital transformation, advanced threats simulations are among the first steps necessary to improve the defense mechanisms and operations of every responsible organization. Even the best trained internal staff cannot replace the support of external experts.</p>
        <p>VULNCHAIN offers a comprehensive approach to your cybersecurity problems, supported by a high-quality report based on passive information gathering.</p>
    </section>

      <ul class="accordion">
        <li>
          <input type="checkbox" id="q1" class="accordion-toggle">
          <label for="q1" class="accordion-title">Red Team</label>
            <div class="content">
              <p>Red Teaming activities include complete, authorized mapping of intruders’ activity, with the knowledge shared only with a few key people inside the organization. Everything is performed exactly as it happens during a real attack, aimed at causing the greatest possible damage to the victim. By testing your systems, employees and procedures, our goal is to improve the defense mechanisms within your company.</p>
              <p>The level of effectiveness achieved in a single simulation mirrors the actual real attack, and the methods used by VULNCHAIN experts do not differ from the advanced methods of cybercriminals.</p>
              <p>Red Team is a comprehensive method that fully reflects a potential attack from the outside. It also precisely reflects its consequences. It is focused on a number of activities related to attempts to break the security of the organization as a whole but with a view to achieve specific goals, such as information theft, modification of code repositories or establishing a permanent presence by simulating the Command&Control server. </p>
              <p>Depending on your needs, we can offer you a controlled “red team” exercise aimed at achieving a specific goal (e.g., gaining remote access to an organization or stealing selected data).</p>
            </div>

          <label for="q2" class="accordion-title">OSINT</label>
          <div class="content">
            <p>One of the most important and popular propositions that you will find in our offer is the so-called OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence). OSINT is a passive gathering of information in Internet resources, taking into account archival resources, darknet (TOR), social media, industry portals or DNS entries.</p>
            <p>Often a publicly available data allows attackers to profile the organization or its specific members and lead to hidden data that may contain sensitive information about the client’s resources.</p>
            <p>Depending on your needs, we can offer you a review of sensitive information about your organization, available on the web.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <input type="checkbox" id="q3" class="accordion-toggle">
          <label for="q3" class="accordion-title">Social engineering tests</label>
          <div class="content">
            <p>The techniques of simulating cyberthreats are tests based on social engineering including phishing simulations. Phishing is one of the most popular and effective methods of attack used by cybercriminals, aimed directly at the weakest link in the organization’s defense mechanism – an unaware employee. </p>
            <p>Phishing attacks include sending email messages containing dangerous attachments or mechanisms aimed at obtaining users’ data. High degree of individualization and catchy content of messages make them very effective (for example if they are created after a careful diagnosis of messages exchanged in an organization) prompting the victim to react immediately without much consideration. </p>
            <p>In phishing simulations, it is very important to be systematic. Systematic approach helps employees increase their awareness and knowledge of methods used by cybercriminals. The report prepared after each individual exercise and the recommendations included allow to explain what went well and in what areas improvements are needed to maximize the collective resistance of the organization to social engineering attacks.</p>
            <p>Depending on your needs, we can offer you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>controlled spear phishing exercises,</li>
                <li>verification of employees’ awareness of social engineering attacks – by email, or using other selected methods (traditional mail, flash memory, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <input type="checkbox" id="q4" class="accordion-toggle">
          <label for="q4" class="accordion-title">Attack simulation from within</label>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Many organizations are increasingly using integrated defense mechanisms. They also invest in courses that increase employee awareness, encryption of stored data, multi-factor authentication, advanced data analysis, continuous diagnostics, monitoring, and incident detection using machine learning and artificial intelligence. This increases the risk of bypassing all those measures by simply bribing employees who have exclusive access to key data. </p>
            <p>Simulation called Insider Threat provides detailed answers to the following questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How can a person interested in an attack initiate and carry out such an action from within?</li>
                <li>Is it possible to embed an attacker within an organization who, under the guise of performing professional work, steals protected data?</li>
                <li>What other threats to the organization may be caused by a malicious (hostile) employee who tries to attack it from within?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This exercise, in addition to providing reliable answers to above questions, strengthens the internal security of the organization and can indicate the symptoms of the presence of an attacker in the network. Recommendations based on the exercise helps to detect such attacks at the earliest possible stage.</p>
            <p>Depending on your needs, we can offer you analysis of organization’s preparation for targeted attacks from within.</p>

          <input type="checkbox" id="q5" class="accordion-toggle">
          <label for="q5" class="accordion-title">Hardening resources</label>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Unauthorized access to systems used by organizations can be very costly in terms of reputational damage, loss of critical customer data, disruptions, delays and often lawsuits. Properly selected cybersecurity services allow you to avoid most of these threats and ensure the reliability of your infrastructure and the services based on it.</p>
            <p>Hardening includes consultations and support in implementation of hardening measures for the configuration of systems and solutions protecting against malware, firewall / WAF / IDS / IPS devices and other products supporting the security of systems and infrastructure. Often, the appropriate configuration of solutions or the operating system significantly increases the level of security, without generating additional costs related to licenses or hardware.</p>
            <p>Hardening resources is a service that, at a relatively low cost, can largely mitigate the risk of cyberattacks for the organization.</p>
            <p>Depending on your needs, we can offer you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>review of current configuration and proposal of changes that will maximize the level of security,</li>
                <li>verification of current configuration in terms of internal legal regulations,</li>
                <li>verification of current configuration in terms of normative requirements (e.g., PCI DSS).</li>
