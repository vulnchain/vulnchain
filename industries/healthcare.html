      <p>We maximize your security and mitigate the risk of cyberthreats.</p>
      <p>In addition to its obvious benefits for patients and medical facilities, technological progress which is constantly taking place in the healthcare sector also means a number of complex challenges. Many of them relate to the effective protection of sensitive data, electronic medical records, patient records and modern devices used to support the work of doctors and medical personnel during various procedures.</p>
      <p>According to cybersecurity specialists, in the turbulent technological reality there is no time for symptomatic treatment of imperfections. What’s needed is an effective overall improvement of the health of the organization and the calibration of internal processes to take control of the areas where security is not always that obvious.</p>
      <p>The growing number of security incidents have an impact on the future of healthcare organizations, regardless of their scale of operations or management structure. High-profile cases of unauthorized access to data, theft of resources, attacks by malware or ransom demands for decryption of disks are only the tip of the iceberg and weaken the security profile not only of individual organizations but also of the entire sector, becoming an incentive for intruders to take further action.</p>
      <p>Innovation in the healthcare sector is constantly growing and include the production and wide implementation of elements such as biosensors, smart devices allowing for remote care and supervision of patients and their drug therapy, components enabling telemedical communication or cloud servers collecting health data. It further justifies the need to urgently take proactive cybersecurity measures.</p>
      <p>Uninterrupted operation of all devices and systems and safe access to patients’ personal data and their medical records can be achieved through the right approach to cybersecurity. Reliability and resistance to attacks are the key elements. Without them it is impossible to freely continue the business processes and the further functioning of the organization in this area.</p>
      <p>Each medical institution should be prepared in such a way that the identification of security vulnerabilities takes place long before they are detected and used by unauthorized persons. The highest guaranteed result leading to their removal is achieved in the process of implementing additional safeguards, preceded by giving accurate and detailed recommendations.</p>

                <p>VULNCHAIN provides professional and comprehensive assistance in diagnosing the main priority of security, regardless of whether it is the security of the infrastructure and the data stored within it, access to applications, compliance with regulations or the implementation process of new solutions.</p>
                <p>Our services allow any medical institution to identify security vulnerabilities before they are used by unauthorized persons. The key effect of our work is the security of the organization, achieved, among others, by providing accurate and detailed recommendations on the effective removal of potential areas of cyberattacks.</p>
