        <p>// Industry</p>

    <section>
      <p>We analyze important security measures that protect e-commerce platforms. </p>
      <p>The unprecedented expansion of e-commerce has dynamically contributed to the streamlining of the purchasing processes and the devaluation of the role of traditional brick-and-mortar stores. In place of the former physical infrastructure, virtual shelves with digital representation of available goods have appeared. Instead of people supervising everyday purchases and transactions, we now have online payment systems. All this is available in online stores and applications for mobile devices that manage our sensitive data.</p>
      <p>With such a dizzying pace of development of the e-commerce industry, it is difficult to indicate the boundary between traditional and modern communication between sellers with customers. The trust of online shoppers plays the most important role in this relationship. To develop and maintain it, one needs to be absolutely sure about the reliability of their payments’ security.</p>
      <p>New technological trends are also spreading in stationary stores and department stores. Good examples are AR & VR services such as beacons connecting to dedicated mobile applications using Bluetooth Low Energy, which take us to an even higher level of shopping.</p>
      <p>The e-commerce industry is becoming more and more popular. E-commerce accounts for a large chunk of the market, and online buying platforms are among the most visited sites. These facts were not overlooked by cybercriminals.</p>
      <p>E-commerce platforms with their functionalities are as safe as the weakest links in the security of their software and hardware solutions. The pace of absorption of new technologies that are revolutionizing this industry increases the total amount of sensitive data that appears in the digital circulation every day. This, in turn, imposes an obligation on the creators of these solutions to care primarily for the broadly understood safety and comfort of users.</p>
      <p>This is especially true today, when we hear about data leaks, identity thefts and financial frauds via fake links leading to websites with fake payment forms.</p>
